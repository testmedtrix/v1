                                    that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals
                                    with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: <a href="https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p><br /><p><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></p><p>

                                    Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&#39;s privacy and safety online

                                    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
                                    Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
                                </p><br /><p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p><p>
                                    We will notify the users via email
                                </p><br /><ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul><br /><p>
                                    We will notify the users via in-site notification
                                </p><br /><ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul><br /><p>
                                    We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals
                                    have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors

                                    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&#39;s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world)
                                    that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals
                                    with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: <a href="https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p><br /><p><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></p><p>

                                    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation&#39;s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
                                    Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&#39;s privacy and safety online

                                    We do not specifically market to children under 13.

                                    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
                                    Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
                                </p><br /><p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p><p>
                                    We will notify the users via email
                                </p><br /><ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul><br /><p>
                                    We will notify the users via in-site notification
                                </p><br /><ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul><br /><p>
                                    We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals
                                    have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors

                                    The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
